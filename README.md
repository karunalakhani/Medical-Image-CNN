My goal is to design a Convolutional Neural Network to identify abnormalities in 3D Chest CT scans.
So, given a test patient folder containing many tiff files, your network should be able to detect the location of abnormalities (similar to how a radiologist checks a patientâ€™s 3D CT scan and marks abnormalities).
